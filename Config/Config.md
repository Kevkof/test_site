### What is changed/What does it do

#### Binaries

- Disabled the ingame VOIP  `(VivoxVoiceService.exe)`
- Disabled the game crash error window `(APB_Catcher.exe)`
- Disabled the ingame browser (the one you use if you login with your email and password) `(APB_Gecko.exe)`

#### APBGame/Config

- This just contains the default quality settings (As Far As I'm Aware) `(APBCompat.ini)`

#### APBGame/Content/Audio

- Ingame music has been removed `(DefaultMusicLibrary)`
- The background sounds in district have been removed `(FilePackages)`
- Themes and player created songs are disabled `(MusicStudio)`
- Some of the noise generating artifacts are removed (for example the boiler in asylum) `(ParameterAssets)`

#### APBGame/Content/Release/Maps

- The login screen graphics are disabled (Credit for this goes to Tobii), this helps lower the launch time `(APBLoginLevel.apb)`

#### APBGame/Movies

- Removed the videos that show at the start (to further lower the launch time), left the other ones in for smoother transitions `(ÃŒntroTitles.bik, SplashScreen.bik)`
