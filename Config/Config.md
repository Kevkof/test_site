### How to install: 

1. Download the config. [link](Kevkof_Config.zip)
2. Install the config: Just copy the 'APB Reloaded' folder from the .zip file to your apb folder (merge both APB Reloaded folders)
3. Launch APB from a special shortcut to allow the use of the custom language files. You'll need to make a shortcut to the `APB.exe` in the folder `APB Reloaded/Binaries` with as additional parameter `-language=1031`

#### APBGame/Content/Audio

- Ingame music has been removed `(DefaultMusicLibrary)`
- The background sounds in district have been removed `(FilePackages)`
- Themes and player created songs are disabled `(MusicStudio)`
- Some of the noise generating artifacts are removed (for example the boiler in asylum) `(ParameterAssets)`

#### APBGame/Content/Release/Maps

- The login screen graphics are disabled (Credit for this goes to Tobii), this helps lower the launch time `(APBLoginLevel.apb)`

#### APBGame/Localization

- Changed the look and feel/text of a number of parts of the game, play the game to find out which changes. `(a lot of them)`

#### APBGame/Movies

- Removed the videos that show at the start (to further lower the launch time), left the other ones in for smoother transitions `(ÃŒntroTitles.bik, SplashScreen.bik)`
