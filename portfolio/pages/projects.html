        <p>During the first year of our education we focussed mainly on the basics such as HTML, CSS and JAVA.
          As a larger semester project we had to code a game in Java. The game was Sokoban that year, but students who
          took those courses before and after me had different games like: Risk, Targui, Magical Maze, ...</p>

          <p>During the first year of the education you have a group project where you along with 3 other students work
            to create a Java application from the <a href="p1g47.html" target="_blank">Use Cases</a> given to you by
            the teachers. All of the code that I wrote/rewrote can be found on <a href="https://github.com/kevkof/P1G47"
              target="_blank">the appropriate git repo</a>.</p>
          <p>Sadly for me I had a rough go with the students I was grouped up with as they all stopped their education
            during that semester. Since they stopped one at a time with a couple weeks in between, there were no
            immediate concerns from the teachers side. Luckily for me the teachers realised by the time that I was all
            alone at the weekly meetings that it was not in any way my fault that they all left before halfway. So they
            cut me a break by cutting some of the later use cases from what I'd have to finish to pass.</p>
          <p>The courses that we had in the first year gave us an introduction to economics, cisco networking, Object
            oriented design and programming, computer hardware and a preamble on algorithms.</p>
        </div>
        <hr class="btmspace-50">
        <h1 id="year2">Year 2</h1>
        <p>In the second year, we got an introduction to both of the major server operating systems as we had classes
          about both Windows Server and Linux. Along with a more in depth look at Cisco iOS in the second semester for
          the students who, like me, specialise in System and network management. Along with those specific courses we
          got classes in business management, the communication between business and IT, SQL, statistics with R, some
          programming with Java and .Net and finally some French and English.</p>
        <header class="heading">System management project</header>
        <p>The assignment consisted of several smaller ones that I'll be discussing a little below. But for now here's
          the info and code we created for all of them <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevkof/P2OPSG7">in a
            github repo</a>, sadly this was written in dutch.</p>

        <h1 id="year3">Year 3</h1>
        <p>For this third and final year we still got some general courses where we were saw amongst others how to
          analyse business processes, an introductionion to big data, a deeper introduction into the usage of
          algorithms and of course a bit more french and english.</p>
        <p>As for the more specific courses for our chosen path within the education, we had courses on Windows Server,
          Enterprise Linux, Cisco networking and a semester project. The second semester is largly occupied by a 14
          week internship and a bachelorpaper along side that.</p>
        <header class="heading">System and network management project</header>
        <p>For this project we worked with all the third year students, who study system and network management, from
          both the Ghent and Aalst campus. All of the students got split into two major teams being the red (windows)
          and green (linux) teams. The teams split themselves up further into sub teams to focus on each server with
          small groups of 2 to 3 students. Not only did we have to build 12 servers but also setup the networking,
          several clients and the firewall as well.<br>
          I was part of the Linux team and focussed on the PXE boot server. All of our servers were built fully
          automated by the use of Ansible. This was for most of us a new technologie that we only used in the
          Enterprise Linux course that we had during the same semester.<br>
          The code and research we did can be found on <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/kevkof/p3ops_backup">github</a>.</p>
        As a represetation of how it was for us here's a tweet from our teacher during our final release
